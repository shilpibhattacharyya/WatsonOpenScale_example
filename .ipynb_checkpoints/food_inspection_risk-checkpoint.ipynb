    "There are over 15,000 food establishments across the City of Chicago that are subject to sanitation inspections by the Department of Public Health. Three dozen inspectors are responsible for checking these establishments, which means one inspector is responsible for nearly 470 food establishments. The Department of Public Health has systematically collected the results of nearly 100,000 sanitation inspections; meanwhile, other city departments have collected data on 311 complaints, business characteristics, and other information. With this information, the city's advanced analytics team and Department of Public Health teamed up to forecast food establishments that are most likely to have critical violations so that they may be inspected first. The result is that food establishments with critical violations are more likely to be discovered earlier by the Department of Public Health's inspectors. \n",
